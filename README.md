# Disaster Tweet Classification
A prediction program that classifies tweets into ones which announce a disaster and others which do not.
The program implements supervised learning using the multinomial naive Bayes classifier, a probabilistic and generative classifier. To deal with unseen events, Laplace smoothing has been implemented.

The data has been taken from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/data). Displaying the code and the data publicly here is in compliance with the rules of the competition.
